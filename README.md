Why do we need it?

Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security threats such as polling booth capturing, vote alteration and manipulation, etc, and also require huge amounts of paperwork, human resources, and time. This creates a sense of distrust among existing systems.


Some of the disadvantages are:

Long Queues during elections.
Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.
Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.
Difficult for differently-abled voters to reach polling booth.
Cost of expenditure on elections is high.


Solution:

E-Voting System is a fast and secure way to cast your vote.
